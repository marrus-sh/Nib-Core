#  Nib Core  #

Core types and behaviours for the Nib ðŸ–‹ family of packages.

___


##  What is this?  ##

[**_Nib_**](https://github.com/marrus-sh/Nib) is a suite of Swift packages serving as a reference implementation for XML and related technologies.

You wonâ€™t find that here, though.
**_Nib Core_** provides all the fundamental protocols, types, and behaviours that the Nib modules depend upon, including things such asâ€¯:â€”

 +  Protocols for interacting with sequences of Unicode scalar values
 +  Protocols for establishing wellformedness and validity
 +  Mechanisms for parsing data from a contextfree grammar (and then some!)


##  Usage  ##

Use [SwiftPM](https://swift.org/package-manager/) to add Nib Core as a dependencyâ€¯:â€”

```swift
//  Add this to the `dependencies` for your project.
.package(
	url: "https://github.com/marrus-sh/Nib-Core.git",
	from: "0.2.0"
)
```

â€”:â€¯and then import it as necessary.
All Nib modules begin with the emoji sigil `U+1F58B ðŸ–‹ LOWER LEFT FOUNTAIN PEN` followed by the module name, so for Nib Core thatâ€™sâ€¯:â€”

```swift
import ðŸ–‹Core
```
