import func Algorithms.chain

/// A thing which can be alternated, catenated, and repeated an indefinite number of times, producing a new thing of the same type.
///
/// A regular expression, as it is commonly conceived, has the following properties:‚Äî
///
///  +  It can be alternated with other regular expressions,
///  +  It can be catenated with other regular expressions, and
///  +  It can be repeated a variable, and possibly infinite, number of times
///
/// ‚Äî:all of which produce a new, meaningful regular expression.
///
/// In üñãü•ë¬†Nib¬†Core, these properties make up the requirements of the aptly-named `ExpressionProtocol`.
/// `ExpressionProtocol` types must implement the following:‚Äî
///
///  +  ``init(alternating:)``, to produce a new expression which alternates its arguments.
///     The infix operator [`|(_:_:)`](doc:_(_:_:)) is defined for `ExpressionProtocol` things such that `A | B` is equivalent to `.init(alternating: [A, B])`.
///
///  +  ``init(catenating:)``, to produce a new expression which represents its arguments in sequence.
///     The infix operator ``&(_:_:)`` is defined for `ExpressionProtocol` things such that `A & B` is equivalent to `.init(catenating: [A, B])`.
///
///  +  `range ‚úñÔ∏è expression`, to produce a new expression which represents `expression` repeated `range` times.
///     The postfix operators [`^?(_:)`](doc:Expressible/__(_:)-7vqvq), [`^+(_:)`](doc:Expressible/_+(_:)-85ze7), and [`^*(_:)`](doc:Expressible/_*(_:)-3qahs) are defined for `ExpressionProtocol` things to be equivalent to `0...1 ‚úñÔ∏è expression`, `1... ‚úñÔ∏è expression`, and `0... ‚úñÔ∏è expression`, respectively.
///
/// When combined, the above operators provide a powerful D¬∑S¬∑L for building `ExpressionProtocol` things.
/// For example:‚Äî
///
/// ```swift
/// 2...5 ‚úñÔ∏è A & (B | C)^?
/// ```
///
/// ‚Äî:means ‚Äúthe expression formed from repeating `A`, optionally followed by `B` or `C`, two to five times‚Äù.
///
/// The compactness of this D¬∑S¬∑L makes it very easy to write expressions which are more complex than Swift can typecheck in reasonable time.
/// The ``&=(_:_:)``, and [`|=(_:_:)`](doc:_=(_:_:)) infix operators are provided to make it easier to break up expressions over multiple lines.
///
///  >  Note:
///  >  üñãü•ë¬†Nib¬†Core makes *no* guarantees about the semantics or results of operations on types conforming to `ExpressionProtocol`; it is up to the type implementation to determine exactly what is meant by such things as ‚Äúalternation‚Äù, ‚Äúcatenation‚Äù, ‚Äúrepetition‚Äù, or ‚Äúexclusion‚Äù and what kinds of expressions result from these operations.
///  >  Conforming to `ExpressionProtocol` simply indicates that things of a type may be constructed using the D¬∑S¬∑L as above.
