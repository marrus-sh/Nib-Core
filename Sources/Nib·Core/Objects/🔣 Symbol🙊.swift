/// A wrapper for a `Symbolic` thing which preserves its `Atom` type but erases other type information.

/// This class effectively allows multiple different `Symbolic` types to be mixed in the same context.
/// It exists as a consequence of limitations in Swiftâ€™s typing system, and may be revised or eliminated in future versions of Swift which no longer require such a classbased approach.
