##  Overview  ##

[**_🖋 Nib_**](https://github.com/marrus-sh/Nib) is a suite of Swift packages serving as a reference implementation for X·M·L and related technologies.

You won’t find that here, though.
**_🖋🥑 Nib Core_** provides all the fundamental protocols, types, and behaviours that the 🖋 Nib modules depend upon, including things such as :—

 +  Value types for representing uncertainty
 +  Protocols for interacting with sequences of Unicode scalar values
 +  Protocols for establishing wellformedness and validity
 +  Protocols for defining expressions which can be composed from other expressions
 +  Generic regular expression matching

For an example of how to use 🖋🥑 Nib Core in your own project, see <doc:Parsing>.
