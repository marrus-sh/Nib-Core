A regular expression, as it is commonly conceived, has the following properties:—

 +  It can be alternated with other regular expressions,
 +  It can be catenated with other regular expressions, and
 +  It can be repeated a variable, and possibly infinite, number of times

—:all of which produce a new, meaningful regular expression.

In 🖋🍎 Nib Core, these properties make up the requirements of the aptly‐named `ExpressionProtocol`.
`ExpressionProtocol` types must implement the following:—

 +  `.init(alternating:...)`, to produce a new expression which alternates its arguments.
    The infix operator `|` is defined for `ExpressionProtocol` values such that `A | B` is equivalent to `init(alternating: A, B)`.

 +  `.init(catenating:...)`, to produce a new expression which represents its arguments in sequence.
    The infix operator `&` is defined for `ExpressionProtocol` values such that `A & B` is equivalent to `init(catenating: A, B)`.

 +  `range × expression`, to produce a new expression which represents `expression` repeated `range` times.
    The postfix operators `^?`, `^+`, and `^*` are defined for `ExpressionProtocol` values to be equivalent to `0...1 × expression`, `1... × expression`, and `0... × expression`, respectively.

 +  For `ExclusionProtocol` types **only**, `.init(excluding:from:)`, to produce a new expression which excludes its first argument from its second.
    The infix operator `÷` is defined for `ExclusionProtocol` values such that `A ÷ B` is equivalent to `.init(excluding: B, from: A)`.

Types whose values represent specific expressions can conform to the `Expressible` protocol by implementing the `^!` postfix operator, which returns the associated `ExpressionProtocol` value.
The `^?`, `^+`, and `^*` postfix operators are similarly defined for `Expressible` types, as a convenience over writing `(🎱^!)^?` or similar.
All `ExpressionProtocol` types are required to be `Expressible` as themselves.

When combined, the above operators provide a powerful D·S·L for building `ExpressionProtocol` values.
For example:—

```swift
2...5 × A & (B | C)^?
```

—:means “the expression formed from repeating `A`, optionally followed by `B` or `C`, two to five times”.

The compactness of this D·S·L makes it very easy to write expressions which are more complex than Swift can typecheck in reasonable time.
The `&=`, `|=`, and `÷=` operators are provided to make it easier to break up expressions over multiple lines.

Nib makes *no* guarantees about the semantics or results of operations on types conforming to `ExpressionProtocol`; it is up to the type implementation to determine exactly what is meant by such things as “alternation”, “catenation”, “repetition”, or “exclusion” and what kinds of expressions result from these operations.
Conforming to `ExpressionProtocol` simply indicates that values of a type may be constructed using the D·S·L as above.
